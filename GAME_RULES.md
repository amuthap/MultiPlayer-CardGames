# Reduce Cards - Game Rules

## Objective
Minimize the total value of cards in your hand. When you think you have the lowest value, you can show your cards to end the game.

## Setup
- Each player receives 5 cards at the start
- One card is placed face-up in the discard pile
- Remaining cards form the deck

## Card Values
- Ace (A): 1 point
- Number cards (2-10): Face value
- Jack (J): 11 points
- Queen (Q): 12 points
- King (K): 13 points
- Jokers: 0 points

## Gameplay

### On Your Turn
You must drop at least one card and may optionally take a card. You have three options:

1. **Drop & Take from Deck**
   - Drop one or more cards with the same rank
   - Take a new card from the deck

2. **Drop & Take from Discard**
   - Drop one or more cards with the same rank
   - Take the top card from the discard pile

3. **Show Cards (End Game)**
   - Reveal your hand to all players
   - If you have the lowest total value, you win!
   - If someone else has a lower value, you lose

### Special Rules

1. **Same Rank - No Take Required**
   - If you drop a single card that matches the rank of the top discard card, you don't need to take a card
   - This reduces your hand size!

2. **Multiple Cards**
   - You can drop 2 or 3 cards of the same rank together
   - You only take back ONE card
   - Great way to reduce hand size!

3. **Winning Condition**
   - When it's your turn, you can choose to "Show Cards"
   - All players reveal their hands
   - If you have the lowest total value, you win
   - If someone has a lower or equal value, you lose

## Strategy Tips
- Try to collect cards with the same rank to drop multiple cards at once
- Watch what other players are doing to estimate their hand values
- Use the special "same rank" rule to reduce your hand size
- Don't show cards too early - make sure you have the lowest value!
- Jokers are worth 0 points - keep them if you get them!

## Example Turn

**Your hand:** 3♥, 3♦, 7♣, K♠, 2♥ (Total: 25)
**Top discard:** 9♦

You could:
- Drop 3♥ and 3♦ together, take one card (reduces hand to 4 cards)
- Drop K♠, take from deck or discard pile
- If confident, show your cards to end the game

## Game End
The game ends when a player shows their cards. All hands are revealed, and the player with the lowest total value wins!
